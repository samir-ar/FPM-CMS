# Changelog

All notable changes to the FPM-CMS (Laravel backend) are documented in this file.

## v1.0.0

First production release after completing the Critical UI redesign, accessibility improvements, backend QR fixes, and membership application flow.

### Added

- `App\Services\QrCodeGenerator` — shared helper for generating base64-encoded PNG QR codes.

### Changed

- QR code generation switched from `simplesoftwareio/simple-qrcode` (Imagick-based) to `endroid/qr-code` (GD-based), since the Imagick PHP extension is not available in this environment.
- `UserRepository::addUser()` now generates a QR code on a member's first registration, closing a gap where new members never received one.
- The existing re-verification branch in `RegistrationController.php` now uses the same shared QR generation helper, removing duplicated logic.

### Fixed

- QR code generation, which previously failed silently (Imagick missing) and left members with no scannable QR code at all.
